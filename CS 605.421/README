Project1.c - uploaded the project1.c code, looking back at how bad this was written makes me laugh but oh well!  Could probably rewrite in half the lines much more efficiently
espcially since I was using Borland C++ as my IDE/compiler back in the day.

If I get some time, will start from scratch and do a rewrite.
